### Stakeholder 1: Diana Pujals (NYU Student, undergraduate, junior)
- **Goals / Needs**
 1. Filter professors by teaching style (group projects, lecture heavy, discussion-based, etc)
 2. See professors' background details (degrees, years of experience, reasons for choosing the profession, etc)
 3. Get matched with a professor based on chosen criteria.
 4. Have one place to see classes and professors with reviews simultaneously

- **Problems / Frustrations**
 1. No way to filter by teaching style on current platforms.
 2. There is no transparency on the professors' qualifications and teaching motivations.
 3. It is time consuming and confusing to switch among from one professor rating to another.
 4. Difficult to keep track checking multiple systems (Albert, external review pages).
